st.write('''
            Autism can be viewed from the [medical or the social model of disability](https://www.disabilitynottinghamshire.org.uk/index.php/about/social-model-vs-medical-model-of-disability/), and as such,
            there are many different ways of defining it.  According to [Autistica](https://www.autistica.org.uk/what-is-autism/what-is-autism),
            autism ‚Äú‚Ä¶affects the way people communicate and experience the world around them.‚Äù  Similarly,
            the [National Autistic Society](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism) defines Autism as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a lifelong developmental disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world.‚Äù

Personally, I like this one by Dr Luke Beardon, Senior Lecturer at The Autism Centre at Sheffield Hallam University:

>‚ÄúAutism refers to a neurotype that leads to a cognition that is qualitatively different from that of the PNT\
 [Predominant Neuro-Type, or non-autistic people] in the way that information specific to communication, social\
 interpretation and interaction is processed and understood; and to a perceptual reality of the sensory environment\
 that differs considerably from one individual to the next.‚Äù ([Beardon, 2017](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Autism-Adults-Luke-Beardon/dp/152937541X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=luke+beardon+autism&qid=1664368608&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjIyIiwicXNhIjoiMi43OCIsInFzcCI6IjIuODIifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=luke+baer%2Caps%2C284&sr=8-2))

It is worth noting that there have been multiple theories regarding autism.  Click [here](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/legacy-special-reports/theories-of-autism/) for a list of articles explaining 7 of them \
    (there are more, but I don't want to go into too much detail).

There is a joke in the autism community which goes like this:
>When you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person.

Consequently, it's very difficult to be universally autism-friendly.\
    I've worked with autistic people whose sensory profile differs significantly from my own. \
I'm photosensitive, so I often wear sunglasses when in meetings.  One autistic person I worked with didn't like this \
    because they couldn't see my eyes.  In the end I took off my sun glasses to appease that person.  That was not a \
    reasonable adjustment.  It was my choice, I decided to do it, and my eyes stung for the duration of the meeting. \
    Other autistic people may not be as accomodating.  It's their choice.''')

st.markdown('''Given that:
1. Autism has [genetic](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-genetics-explained/) and environemntal causes;
2. Research into those causes are on-going; and
3. Autism is diagnosed by observing [behaviour](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/getting-diagnosed/how-to-get-diagnosed/);
4. It's no wonder that there is so much heterogeneity (i.e., difference) among those of us whom are autistic.''')

    coined the term back in the late 90s.  Read this [blog post](https://neurodiversity2.blogspot.com/p/what.html) for proof.  \
    According to Singer, Neurodiversity:
* is a feature of Earth as a whole, since humans have colonized all Earth's ecosystems;
* refers specifically to the limitless variability of human cognition and the uniqueness of each human mind;
* was coined, [Judy believes], by [herself] in the 1990s, as a political term to argue for the importance of including all neurotypes \
for a thriving human society.

Furthermore, the neurodiversity movement is "an evolving, decentralized and leaderless social movement".  Judy's book, [NeuroDiversity: \
The Birth of an Idea](https://www.amazon.com/NeuroDiversity-Birth-Idea-Judy-Singer-ebook/dp/B01HY0QTEE/), is a thought-provoking read for those of \
        you whom prefer to go into more detail on the origins of neurodiversity.

st.markdown('''Personally, I have misgivings about the neurodiversity movement.  Whilst I agree that everyone has a story \
    to tell and should have the opportunity to participate in society, for some the harsh \
    reality is that they won't be able to do that without significant on-going support and, as things stand, UK society has multiple issues to consider:
* there's an on-going [cost of living crisis]('https://www.theguardian.com/business/cost-of-living-crisis');
* the cost of one war is significant, in terms of lives and resources, so getting involved in two for whatever reason will be \
costly ([the UK only paid off its WWII debt in 2006](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/business/worldbusiness/28iht-nazi.4042453.html));
* as of June 2023 there's a [¬£28.5 billion trade deficit]('https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/balanceofpayments/apriltojune2023') \
            that will need to be paid to residents outside of the UK;
* the NHS is overburdened; and
* many more besides.

For me, advocates for the neurodiversity movement try \
        to accentuate the positives of difference, which is great, but I've come to sympathise with parents and/or  neurodivergent people whom feel \
        misrepresented and even more marginalised as a consequence.

I spent the first 26 years of my life trying to be something/someone that I wasn't designed to be, and my mental health \
    suffers to this day as result.  In spite of this, I'm able to recognise that there are other people out there whose needs far outweigh my own. \
    Unfortunately life isn't fair, so I encorage you to be mindful that for every [Elon Musk](https://www.axios.com/2022/04/15/elon-musk-aspergers-syndrome), \
    there might be hundreds of thousands of people who can't make themselves understood (I'm talking about autistic people in this context and \
    it's a conservative guess on my part); that won't change unless everyone learns to communicate respectfully in a manner which \
       can be understood by their audience.  I'm willing to take that challenge on.  Are you?
